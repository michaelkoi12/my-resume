    <h2>Family Time</h2>
    <p>I love to spend time with my wife and kiddos. I currently have 4 children (2 boys, 2girls) and its the best to come home 
        after a long day at work and see their happy faces. We love spending time together outdoors and tinkering in the shop.
        my oldest boy is starting to get into video games so we started playing nintendo switch together. Its fantastic seeing
        what they pick up and things they notice.

    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>My greatest passion outside of my family is fishing. specifically walleye fishing. I love getting out on the water in
        the summer months and getting into a great walleye bite. There's just nothing better in my opinion. Can be incredibly 
        relaxing and a great way to get some fresh air and spend time in the great outdoors. I also love ice fishing in the winter 
        when the land turns into a frozen wasteland here in Minnesota. The best part is the kids are getting old enough to get out 
        and enjoy this time with me.
